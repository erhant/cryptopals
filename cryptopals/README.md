# Cryptopals

This repository has my [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) solutions, which are a set of cryptography-related programming challenges.

Each challenge is run as a test, stored under `pkg/setN/chalM_test.go` for some set `N` and challenge `M`. I try to put all set related codes under that respective set folder, though sometimes a code is used by many challenges on different sets.

## Challenges

- [Set 1](./pkg/set1/): [Basics](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1)
  - [x] [Challenge 1](./pkg/set1/chal1_test.go): [Convert `hex` to `base64`](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/1)
  - [x] [Challenge 2](./pkg/set1/chal2_test.go): [Fixed XOR](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/2)
  - [x] [Challenge 3](./pkg/set1/chal3_test.go): [Single-byte XOR cipher](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/3)
  - [x] [Challenge 4](./pkg/set1/chal4_test.go): [Detect single-character XOR cipher](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/4)
  - [x] [Challenge 5](./pkg/set1/chal5_test.go): [Implement repeating-key XOR](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/5)
  - [x] [Challenge 6](./pkg/set1/chal6_test.go): [Break repeating-key XOR](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/6) there is a bug here?
